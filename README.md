## Feature
### Customizable Appearance
QBPopupMenu is highly customizable, so you can create your own popup menu.

The simple way to customize is set `color` and `highlightcolor` property of `QBPopupMenu`.  
If you want to customize deeply, you should create a subclass of `QBPopupMenu` and override some drawing methods.

`QBPlasticPopupMenu` class in this repository is a good example of subclassing.

### Auto Pagenation
If you add many items to `QBPopupMenu`, it create pages and pagenator automatically.

### Auto Bounding
`QBPopupMenu` automatically adjust its frame depending on the frame of target view.


## Example
    QBPopupMenuItem *item = [QBPopupMenuItem itemWithTitle:@"Text" target:self action:@selector(action:)];
    QBPopupMenuItem *item2 = [QBPopupMenuItem itemWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image"] target:self action:@selector(action:)];

    QBPopupMenu *popupMenu = [[QBPopupMenu alloc] initWithItems:@[item, item2]];

    [popupMenu showInView:self.view targetRect:... animated:YES];
